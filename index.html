<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My nationality is Cambodian, I can speak Khmer and English. I completed my secondary education at Keysborough Secondary College and now currently studying IT at RMIT University. I am in interested in web development, which is why i picked up IT. The reason why I am interested in IT is mainly because of video games. In high school we were able to create a simple game using the software GameMaker, which I had found quite interesting. I chose to study at RMIT as I heard they were one of the best universities alongside with Swinburne for their Information Technology course by friends and families. During my studies, I expect to learn how to program and create simple websites.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am from the Philippines and I am of full Filipino descent. I speak both English and Tagalog. My experience in education is the typical 12 to 13 years of schooling, including both primary and secondary learning. I went to St. Matthew&rsquo;s Primary School in North Fawkner and for secondary education, I went to Kolbe Catholic College in Greenvale Lakes. My hobbies include playing games, editing videos and also taking naps. I am also interested in sports, there being only two actually, being Basketball and Soccer. My favourite players in the respective sports are Kyrie Irving and Leroy Sane. My interest in IT comes from a very young age as I&rsquo;ve always been playing games since then, through this course I wish that I can obtain a job that I am passionate in doing whilst also making enough money.</span></p>

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My nationality is Vietnamese nationality and culture, so far my education has just been primary school and highschool with a bit of vietnamese on the side but ended it at year 10, I can speak english and vietnamese, and a bit of japanese. An interesting fact about me is I had a twin brother. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">My interest in IT is pretty much anything to do with S new technology, it started when i was a kid when i first had a computer, it fascinated me when i was young on how "complex" it was to me when i was as a kid and from the start of that it made me interested in very similar technological things although the technologies were not as advanced at those times compared to now. So far my IT experience is pretty much limited to school work, doing certificate of information technology, programming classes and info technology. I chose RMIT because it looked like the best and it pretty much represents technology as it has technology in the name, I've heard a lot of decent reviews about it.</span></p>

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I, along with my other fellow kind define ourselves as Chindos. We are Chinese Indonesians where our family migrated and currently comes from Indonesia, but we are of Chinese descent. In the past I have completed VCE through the normal 13 years of schooling here in Australia. I started primary school in St. Catherine&rsquo;s where I then completed high school certificate within Beaconhills College and Salesian College. I am now currently in my first year of university, studying a bachelor or I.T. at RMIT. I can speak 2 languages fluently; Indonesian and English, however I can also understand basic phrases in Chinese and French. Although I am studying an I.T course, It was never my plan to put the courses in my preference list.</span></p>

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My nationality is Lebanese, and I am also a Muslim, pretty much meaning that I am restricted from doing lots of fun and reckless stuff. It does however give me a different view on life and how to approach lots of situations, thinking more about the future rather than just simply the present. This also means I speak Arabic to some extent as well as English. I learnt Italian in high school but I only ever learnt simple words and phrases so I wouldn&rsquo;t count it as a language I speak. I have just recently finished year 12 and received my VCE certificate, allowing me swift entry into RMIT University, which so far has been a pleasant experience. My main hobby that consumes the majority of my time is gaming. I have always been a gamer at heart since I first started playing console games back when I was 5 years old, starting with the Nintendo GameCube. In 2013 I started playing Team Fortress 2 on the computer and ever since then I have been part of the PC master race and have never looked back (excluding console exclusive titles that come out from time to time alongside classic titles.)&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>These are our thoughts regarding our ideal jobs after researching this data.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Sulaiman Dayoub</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at the Burning Glass data has opened my eyes to the popularity of Solutions Architect and Graphics Designer and how in demand they are. However this hasn&rsquo;t changed my mind on my dream job as my job is still high in demand (Network Engineer) and is personally more interesting over the other alternatives on the list. Systems engineer did pique my interests seeing it 4th from the top, however the likelihood of staying with the Network dream is still high as the skill-set required for that job relates to me more than that of Systems Engineer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Jeiel Roco</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I always had my mind set on a job that would net a good amount of money and would be interesting for me. Upon seeing the Burning Glass data i noticed that my ideal job choice (Software Engineer) was sitting around the middle on the list (11th). This has made me consider looking into Java Developing as well since it relates to my initial job. However I feel that the broader skill-set available in Software Engineering as well as the high potential for income make my initial ideal dream job the one that I will pursue.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Danny Nguyen</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I really wanted to pursue a job that tied in with augmented reality as I found that so interesting to me. However upon viewing the Burning Glass data I noticed that being a Java developer is high in demand and ties closely with the skill-set required for developing A.R. This has made me solidify my ideal job being a Java developer with aspirations to pursue a final job in the augmented reality sector.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Andreas Tan</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My Ideal job is currently being a Systems administrator and whilst looking through the Burning Glass data i noticed that the job was sitting comfortably at 8th place on the list. Although I did look into Systems Engineer after seeing its ranking, I ultimately settled for the System administrator role as the skill-set appealed to me more than the System Engineer role.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><br /><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Steven Saing</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My interest in Web Development is what made me come to RMIT, after looking at the Burning Glass data I haven&rsquo;t changed my opinion much. While the Web Developer title is pretty low on the list, at #15, this hasn&rsquo;t completely dissuaded me from pursuing this position especially since positions in IT can be rather volatile and Web Development could have a greater demand in the future. The other job titles that are above Web Developer are not that appealing to me so I&rsquo;m still sticking with my original choice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Frank Morrison</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After researching the most recent Burning Glass data I was interested by the high ranking of the Graphic Designer title. Compared to my listed ideal job of Ux Designer, it is much higher on the list, sitting at #2, while Ux Designer is closer to the bottom at #21. This has influenced my opinion for my ideal job as there is such a large discrepancy between the 2 and both are appealing to me and require similar skill-sets. This data has lead me to change my focus towards Graphic Design, however, due to the similar skill-sets if the rankings change dramatically, as is likely for IT positions, I should be able to pivot back to my original choice of Ux Designer with relative ease.</span></p>

                  <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Clouds, services, servers </strong></p>
                  <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What does it do?</strong></p>
                  <p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</strong></em><strong><em><br /></em></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment, there are many forms and uses of clouds, services and servers. One that is well known is Google Drive, &nbsp;which is an online storage service that allows a user to not only store their files, but to also share it or even download files from other users. Other forms of clouds, services and servers are used by organisations to store their data and information </span></p>
                  <p><em><strong>What can be done now?</em><em><br /></strong></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of right now, clouds, services and servers provide many benefits to society. Currently, we are able to store files, data and information online that can be accessed at any location as long as the user has access to the internet. This is extremely helpful for businesses and individuals who are always on the move and require large amounts of storage without having to carry around a portable hard drive, USB, etc. &nbsp;Clouds, services and servers also allows individual to share their work with others, regardless of where their location is, through the internet mass amounts of data, information and files could be sent to anywhere on the globe. We can see this almost everywhere, one example being, when a customer purchases music, movies, games, etc. online and they download it, such files are stored on a server where it can be easily downloaded by countless amount of customers. Not only does this pose as a benefit to the customer, but also to the business/company as they can expand the sales they make not only through physical copies but also through digital. Overall this allows the transactions between business and customers to be almost effortless as they don&rsquo;t need to physically go to shops anymore to purchase these items, this would also encourage the customer to keep using this platform to purchase their needs and wants. Another example highlighting the benefits of clouds, services and servers is the way that companies and businesses use them in order to backup their information and data and to also share it with their employees. While business/companies still use onsite physical servers to store their data and information, many are opting to use cloud services to store their data and information. Due to the fact that this decreases the risk from environmental threats, accidental threats and manmade threats. However, the company/business would be allowing a third party access to their data and information so the use of services, clouds and servers also come with its cons. </span></p>
                  <p><em><strong>What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</strong> </em><strong><em><br /></em></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the current rate of progression in technological advances, in the next 3 years it is likely that the storage that clouds, services and servers provide would continue to increase. As of right now gigabytes to terabytes to zettabytes of storage are available for companies to store their data and information on. In the current future it is possible that the these amounts could increase, that would allow for a massive boost in data and information stored on these clouds, services and servers. &nbsp;Another possibility is that the speed of transfer, whether it be uploading or downloading, would increase in the future. As of right now this speed is highly dependant on the speed of the internet being used by the individual/company/business. As our technology advances it is possible that our internet speeds would receive an increase in speed which of course would reflect on the speed of transfer provided by these cloud servers and services. </span></p>
                  <p><em><strong>What technological or other developments make this possible?</em><em><br /></strong></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The factor that would allow for these improvements on clouds, services and servers is the progression in our understanding of technology. As the years go by and the more we evolve with our technology, the more possibilities that we can create in regards to clouds, services and servers. By also researching and developing better understanding of digital storage and the internet, we could improve the state of our current cloud, servers and services. </span></p>
                  <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What is the likely impact?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Which people will be most affected and how?<br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is hard to determine which target group would be the most impacted as both companies/businesses and individuals use clouds, servers and services. It would be best to say that both parties would be affected positively, with the progressions being made. On the business/company side of things, they would be affected as improvements on clouds, services and servers could improve the way that the business/company functions. It could increase the efficiency and effectiveness of how they perform tasks, for example an improvement of speed and storage space would allow a company to perform faster backups, if they were originally undergoing weekly backups for example because of the improvement on the speed and storage, they could upgrade into doing daily full backups so that they could improve the effectiveness of their data storing procedures. On the other hand, individuals such as customers or employees, would be impacted positively by the increase in speed and storage of the cloud, services and servers, due to the fact that they would be able to download files faster whether it be a file related to work or something such as a movie, game or album. Uploading data, information and files would also benefit, since the storage space and speed increases, the user is given the opportunity to store more items through cloud. </span></p>
<p><strong>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?<br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">As our internet and storage facilities upgrade their current services and functions, technology such as USBs and portable hard drives could be made obsolete by the improvements on clouds, servers and services. Due to the fact that these days, most places have access to internet and thus the process of storing data on the internet could prove to be a more effective and efficient way of storing data on the go. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>How will this affect you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>In your daily life, how will this affect you?<br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of clouds, services and servers affects my daily life quite heavily due to the fact that I am a university student and most of the work that I do is stored on Google Drive. This platform of storing is crucial in my daily life as not only does it allow me to store my work on it, but it also gives me the ability to collaborate or share my work with other students or people. </span></p>
<p><strong>What will be different for you?<br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">If in the current future, the speed and the storage capacity of clouds, services and servers are improved it could mean a huge difference to me. This is because I am an individual that likes to store my work, files, data and information online so that I can access it on the go. If the capacity of clouds services increase, it is possible that I might not even need to use the storage that my laptop provides but instead store everything online as it would achieve the same thing and also provides more benefits. Also, since I am an individual that likes to download things such as games, music and movies though the internet, if there was an increase in the speed of transfer in regards to cloud, services and servers. I would be more inclined in purchasing my needs and wants online as it would be more effective and efficient than purchasing it physically. </span></p>
<p><strong>How might this affect members of your family or your friends?<br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my family, my parents would barely be affected if there were improvements due to the fact that they themselves don&rsquo;t use or rely on these services. However, my siblings who have grown up around an abundance of technology around them could be impacted heavily as they grow older due to the fact that they would rely and use services, clouds and servers as the years go by whether it be for educational purposes or for leisure. My friends would be affected in a similar way that I am affected, since most if not all of my friends are also undergoing first year tertiary education, we all currently require the benefits of using clouds, services and servers and its impact could increase as the years go by where we need to store everything online. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Blockchain and Cryptocurrency</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What does it do?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</strong> <br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To begin, Cryptocurrency is a type of currency that does not take the usual physical form of currency. It resides online and is not supported by the government but instead supported by the networks that are responsible for them. As of right now there are many forms of cryptocurrency ranging from Bitcoin, Dash, Ethereum, Litecoin and many more. Along with this, they also vary in the value that they possess in the market, with Bitcoin leading the charge with a current value of over $5000 for one individual Bitcoin. The prices of Cryptocurrencies are not set in stone as many factors will be taken into account that will determine the value that it possesses, they could range from a couple of cents to a couple of thousands in dollars. This type of currency is stored in a digital wallet that could be accessed through a desktop or on a phone, this wallet allows the customer to perform secure transactions to send, receive, sell or buy all forms of digital currency.</span></p>
<p><strong>What can be done now?<br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of right now, there are stores and companies that accept some forms of cryptocurrency, most often Bitcoin, when a customer decides to use this form of payment. However due to its nature, many stores and companies choose not to deal in Cryptocurrency or allow the option to do so, due to the fact that the value that it possesses is not set and could fluctuate at any time. There are already a huge number of things that you could purchase through cryptocurrency, whether it be digitally or physically. Things such as games, cars, giftcards, clothes, flights and even hotels are able to be purchased or used through the transaction of cryptocurrency but the difficulty in doing so would be finding the seller or company that would allow for such transaction to occur in the first place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</strong> <br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the next 3 years, it is possible that more companies and stores will accept the form of cryptocurrency as a payment. Meaning that it could be a regular thing in the future for an individual to use something like Litecoin, which has less value than Bitcoin but is more affordable, to purchase their needs or wants whether it be online or physically. &nbsp;Another possibility is that there are more types of cryptocurrencies that will be released in the future that also range in their value on the market, along with this is the possibility that the value of current cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, could double its price or more surprisingly, suffer a huge loss in its value. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What technological or other developments make this possible?<br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The developments that will allow for these possibilities to occur is the evolution of our society and the way that we are trying to discover new ways of doing things. As the years go by, there is a good possibility that applications will be created that will allow companies or stores to deal in cryptocurrency. Which could result in a boost of transactions being completed through cryptocurrency and could rival that of the normal currency we have at the moment. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What is the likely impact?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What is the potential impact of this development?</strong> <br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a number of things that the development of blockchain and cryptocurrency can impact. For example, the economy could be impacted if the use of cryptocurrency becomes a regularity and used more than physical currency, &nbsp;when used in transactions between customers and sellers. This could then increase the importance of digital currency and thus increase its value and the opposite will happen to our current physical currency, it would lose its importance, usage and the value that it possesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Which people would be likely most affected?</strong> <br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If such changes and developments do occur in the future, it is guaranteed that everyone would be highly impacted due to the fact that as a society, we would have to change the way proceed transactions and other things. People who work at money mints could lose their jobs as the use of cash and coins would be made obsolete by the use of digital cryptocurrency. The government would also be affected because they would have to create new laws and rules regarding the use of digital currency and of course, everyone else would be affected because we would have to get used to and learn how to use cryptocurrency. Also, the way that companies and organisations distribute their salaries would not be in the form of our current currency but in a form of digital currency. </span></p>
<p><strong>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?<br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">As previously mentioned, people who work at money mints would be affected greatly because they would not need to manufacture as many bills and coins as they previously did. Our current physical currency in the form of coins and bills would be made obsolete and would be replaced by the digital cryptocurrency. However, if the introduction of cryptocurrency as the official and primary currency happens, it would also create new jobs, for example someone might be in charge of ensuring that the market of cryptocurrency stays stable and it would also create new technologies, the current digital wallets could be improved and even made into their own standalone devices. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>How will this affect you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>In your daily life, how will this affect you?<br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">These changes and developments would greatly impact me as nowadays as a student and teenager, I make many transactions everyday whether it be buying food, clothes, games, educational needs, etc. I would have to learn how this new currency works and how I could use it to buy the things I want and need. It would also impact me positively because all the transactions that I participate in, could be paid for without having to carry around coins or cash, but only use my phone to access my digital wallet. </span></p>
<p><strong>What will be different for you?<br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are numerous things that would be different for me if such changes and developments were to occur in the near future. One being the way I would receive payment at work, if society doesn&rsquo;t use dollars, pounds, etc. anymore. &nbsp;We would instead receive bank transfers that is entirely made up of a digital currency. Another thing that would be different is that I would need to get used to in trading with cryptocurrency when I want to buy something from a seller, the new terms and procedures that I would need to learn would be a huge difference for me as I would need to adjust. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This would affect everyone in my family and all my friends, as they would also need to adjust and learn the works of using cryptocurrency to buy and sell. Considering that my parents are not that tech savvy, it could mean that the introduction of a digital currency could be a difficult concept for them to grasp meaning that it would taking a long time for them to fully understand it. My friends would not be as affected though considering the fact that they have grown in an environment where technology and digital items are &ldquo;normal&rdquo;, instead they would just need a short time to adjust and then they would be able to understand the concept. </span></p>

                      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RoboDrobe is smart and automated wardrobe. The RoboDrobe is a premium product and as such will provide a world class user experience. Initially, the wardrobe will be tailored in size and capacity according to the users&rsquo; needs for the ultimate user experience. The wardrobe will be equipped with voice recognition and a large mirror that also functions as a touch screen panel that displays and controls all the parts of the smart wardrobe, allowing for the user to set up a multitude of preferences that will allow the wardrobe to function on its own overtime. The panel will also display features such as forecasts, current fashion trends, suggest pieces of clothing that the user can purchase to complete &nbsp;fashionable outfits as well as the time in the top corner of the display. The wardrobe will be linked to the internet as well as the users&rsquo; calendar, allowing for the wardrobe to be aware of the temperature and the location/dress-code of the event you will be attending. The wardrobe will have an input on the rightmost closet that accepts any clothing that the user places into it and sorts that clothing out into categories for both the wardrobe and the user to utilise. Integration with the users social media and email will allow them to receive notifications regarding current trends and sales from their favourite brands. The user can setup and name his/her own presets or allow the wardrobe to make its own presets that the user can view and modify via the touch screen panel. The user will be given three main options: manually choosing pieces of clothing and hence using the smart wardrobe as a regular one whenever he/she wishes, allowing the smart wardrobe to come up with an outfit based on the time of the event and the occasion based off online trends and fashion databases through utilisation of present clothing that the user inputs into the system, and finally the user can create a set of presets for their favourite outfits that they can retrieve &nbsp;on demand for maximum convenience. Those are the primary features of the wardrobe, however for extra costs the wardrobe can be fitted with attachments to further make the users&rsquo; experience truly unique. An example of an attachment the user could purchase is an ironing station that can be attached to the clothing input which automatically irons and handles any clothing present using robotic arms that detect and manoeuvre the clothing appropriately and carefully before placing said clothing into the wardrobe input for sorting. Although not specified above, the smart wardrobe caters for all pieces of clothing, not just torso and leg clothing. This ranges from: hats, gloves, shoes, scarves, ties etc. All of these features merge seamlessly together on the glass display to allow for the best possible user experience a wardrobe can provide on the market. </span></p>
